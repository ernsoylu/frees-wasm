//! Parametric run-tables — sweeping a document and reading the table back.
//!
//! Port of `../frEES/backend/core/src/main/java/com/frees/backend/core/ParametricAccessorContext.java`
//! (159 LOC) and the run driver `SolveController.computeSolveTable` /
//! `solveTableRows` / `solveTableWithAccessors` / `buildColumns` /
//! `columnsConverged` / `solveTableRow`
//! (`../frEES/backend/web/src/main/java/com/frees/backend/api/SolveController.java`).
//! The declaration this executes is [`ParametricTable`], parsed by
//! [`crate::parser::toplevel`] into [`crate::parser::blocks`].
//!
//! # What a parametric run is
//!
//! A `PARAMETRIC` block declares columns and their values:
//!
//! ```text
//! PARAMETRIC drive (t, v, P)
//!   t = 0:2:30
//! END
//! ```
//!
//! `t` is *swept* (16 values), `v` and `P` are declared **outputs** with no
//! cells. One run per row: the row's non-`None` cells are pinned, the document
//! is re-solved, and the solved values fill the output columns. That is why a
//! sweep document is legitimately underspecified on its own — the base system
//! has one degree of freedom that the swept column supplies — and why a plain
//! Solve of `fixtures/corpus-pending/corpus/driving-cycle-energy.frees` fails
//! with `SolverException` in the Java engine too.
//!
//! # How a row is pinned: text, not overrides
//!
//! `solveTableRow` appends `\n<name> = <value>` to the document for every
//! non-null cell and re-solves the result. That is not an implementation
//! shortcut to route around — pinning a swept variable has to make it a
//! **known**, i.e. an equation, and `VariableOverride` only carries a guess and
//! bounds. [`row_source`] does exactly what the Java does, which is also what
//! makes a row a self-contained job: a string plus settings, nothing shared.
//!
//! # The accessors, and why they need a fixed point
//!
//! `TableSum('P')`, `TableAvg`, `IntegralValue('P', 't')`, `TableValue(run,
//! col)`, `TableRun#` and `NParametricRuns` let an equation in *one* row read an
//! aggregate of *every* row — `E_total = IntegralValue('P', 't')` is the whole
//! cycle's energy, identical in every row. That is circular by construction, so
//! the Java solves the table as a Gauss–Seidel fixed point: pass 0 runs with no
//! table data installed (every accessor reads 0), each later pass installs the
//! columns collected from the previous pass, and the loop stops when the columns
//! stop moving or [`MAX_PARAMETRIC_PASSES`] is reached. [`run_sweep`] is that
//! loop.
//!
//! # Threading: the shape is the point (decision D3)
//!
//! `docs/decisions/0003-threading-model.md` chose a pool of independent workers
//! over shared memory, and named parametric sweeps as the case that pays for it.
//! Nothing here spawns, locks or shares: a run is described by a
//! [`RowJob`] — an owned source string and a run index — and answered by a
//! [`RowOutcome`], so a pool can drive [`ParametricTable::rows`]-derived jobs
//! directly and reassemble the outcomes in order. The one thing that cannot fan
//! out is an accessor table, which is table-wide by definition; the Java refuses
//! to chunk those for the same reason (`SolveController.solveTable`, "accessor
//! tables keep their table-wide fixed-point semantics and stay one serial
//! task").
//!
//! The Java's context is a `ThreadLocal` because its evaluator reaches it
//! through a static. A thread-bound global would be both meaningless and
//! unavailable in wasm, so the port passes [`ParametricAccessors`] explicitly
//! and models "no parametric solve is active" as `None` — the null the Java's
//! `CURRENT.get()` returns, with the same defaults on every accessor.
