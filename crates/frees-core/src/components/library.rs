//! The built-in standard component library — 295 components, embedded as
//! `.frees` text and parsed by the ordinary front end.
//!
//! Port of
//! `../frEES/backend/core/src/main/java/com/frees/backend/parser/ComponentLibrary.java`
//! (86 LOC).
//!
//! # The library is data, not code
//!
//! The Java keeps the standard library in frEES source — 13 per-domain
//! `resources/components/*.frees` files — rather than as hand-built ASTs,
//! because that "keeps the physics transparent and editable, and exercises the
//! same parse path as user-authored components". This port keeps that property
//! exactly: the same 13 files are vendored verbatim under `library-data/`,
//! embedded with `include_str!` ([`FILES`]), and handed to the ordinary
//! [`parse_document`] front end. There is no second grammar here and not one
//! hand-translated component. A component that fails to parse is a grammar bug,
//! not a licence to rewrite the component.
//!
//! # Parse order and assembly
//!
//! The Java concatenates the files in a fixed order (`DOMAIN_FILES`), separating
//! each with `"\n\n"`, and parses the single resulting string once. [`source`]
//! reproduces that string byte for byte. [`Library::load`] instead parses **one
//! file at a time**, so every definition can carry the domain file it came from
//! — the source file the inventory owes the metadata/UI layer. The two are
//! equivalent (a `COMPONENT … END` block never spans a file boundary) and
//! `tests::per_file_parsing_matches_the_javas_single_concatenated_parse` pins
//! that they stay so.
//!
//! # Lookup semantics (checked against the Java, not assumed)
//!
//! * **Names are stored lowercase.** `AstBuilder.buildComponentDef` does
//!   `ctx.IDENT().getText().toLowerCase()`, and `buildComponentInst` lowercases
//!   the instantiated type the same way, so lookup is case-insensitive. This
//!   port lowercases with `to_ascii_lowercase`, the convention already used for
//!   identifiers throughout the crate.
//! * **A user definition shadows a built-in of the same name, silently.**
//!   `ComponentExpander`'s constructor loads `builtinDefs` into a
//!   `LinkedHashMap` first and then `put`s every user definition over the top —
//!   "built-in standard-library components are curated; a user definition of the
//!   same name overrides the built-in".
//! * **Two *user* definitions of one name are a hard error** —
//!   `"COMPONENT '<name>' is defined more than once."` Two *built-ins* of one
//!   name are not checked by the Java at all (the later one silently wins); the
//!   shipped library contains no duplicate, which the tests pin rather than
//!   trust.
//!
//! [`Library::resolve`] is that rule, in one place, for the expander to consume.
//!
//! # No defaults, by design
//!
//! Every library parameter is required at instantiation — the Java's class
//! comment is explicit that "a silent default for a physical input (a pipe
//! length, a fluid, an efficiency) is a footgun: a model of an R134a system that
//! forgets `fluid$` should error, not quietly run as water". The one exception
//! the text itself carries is `model$` (and the reserved connector-type selector
//! `domain$`), whose default selects a component's default physics variant.
//! Nothing here enforces that; it is a property of the data, and
//! `tests::library_parameters_carry_no_defaults_except_model` keeps it true.
