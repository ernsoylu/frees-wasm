//! End-to-end steady solve: source text in, solved variables out.
//!
//! This is the Rust counterpart of the two entry points the parent engine
//! exposes over HTTP (`../frEES/backend/web/.../CheckController.java` and
//! `SolveController`), both of which delegate to
//! `../frEES/backend/core/.../EquationSystemSolver.java`:
//!
//! * [`check`] mirrors `POST /api/check` — verify syntax and *structural*
//!   solvability (zero degrees of freedom plus a complete equation↔variable
//!   matching) and report the counts, **without solving anything**. The
//!   frontend gates its Solve button on this.
//! * [`solve`] mirrors `POST /api/solve` — the full pipeline
//!   `parse → collect equations → apply GUESS → block → Newton per block`.
//!
//! # The pipeline
//!
//! The stage order is the Java order, established by reading
//! `EquationParser.parseResult` and `EquationSystemSolver.solve`:
//! `parseResult` lexes/parses, collects `FUNCTION`/`PROCEDURE`/`MODULE`/`TABLE`
//! definitions, **expands components**, then **flattens statements** —
//! `CALL` statements become binding equations and matrix constructs become
//! scalar equations *at parse time* — and `solve` then applies
//! `ComplexExpansion.expand` (when complex mode is on) before blocking. Hence:
//!
//! 1. **Parse.** [`crate::parser::parse_document`]. A block construct the wasm
//!    port has not reached yet is an explicit error, never a silent skip
//!    (`SYMBOLIC` is refused here too).
//! 2. **Expand components.** [`expand_component_layer`] — the acausal
//!    `COMPONENT`/`connect` layer, at `EquationParser.parseResult:292-306`.
//!    It runs **before** every other expansion pass and seeds the equation
//!    list, because the Java writes `new BoundedEquationList(componentEquations)`
//!    and then flattens the statements *into* it. The component layer is a
//!    parser/expander, not a second solver: what comes out is flat scalar
//!    equations that take the same Newton/Tarjan path as everything else.
//! 3. **Flatten CALLs.** [`crate::procedures::flatten_calls`] — the CALL half
//!    of `EquationParser.flatten`. (Phase-4 stub: refuses CALLs by name.)
//! 4. **Expand matrices.** [`crate::parser::expand::expand_document`] — the
//!    matrix half of `EquationParser` (multiAssign, rangeAssign, linear-algebra
//!    intrinsics). Scalar documents pass through byte-identical.
//! 5. **Expand complex.** [`crate::parser::complex::expand_complex`] with
//!    [`SolverSettings::complex_mode`] — `EquationSystemSolver.solve`'s
//!    `ComplexExpansion.expand` site, *after* parse-time flattening.
//! 6. **Seed.** Every unknown starts at [`DEFAULT_GUESS`] (`1.0`, the Java
//!    `EquationSystemSolver.DEFAULT_GUESS`) with bounds `±∞`; in-text `GUESS`
//!    directives override the guess and narrow the bounds, and the guess is
//!    clamped into the bounds exactly as `withTextGuesses` does.
//! 7. **Block.** [`crate::solver::blocker::block_system`] — degrees of freedom,
//!    maximum bipartite matching, Tarjan SCC. The blocks come out in solve
//!    order.
//! 8. **Solve.** [`crate::solver::newton::newton_solve`] per block, in that
//!    order, inside the Java retry ladder (see `solve_block_with_fallback`
//!    below): transformed-guess retries, a univariate bracketing rescue, block
//!    merging, then a best-effort polish pass. Residuals evaluate through
//!    [`crate::eval::eval_with`] with the document's definitions in context,
//!    so user `FUNCTION`s and `TABLE`s work the moment their evaluator lands.
//!    Values solved by an earlier block are already in the shared scope
//!    when a later block is evaluated, which is what "feed knowns forward"
//!    means here — a downstream block never re-solves an upstream unknown.
//!
//! # Built-in constants fold at parse time
//!
//! Like the Java `AstBuilder.visitVarAtom`, the expression parser substitutes
//! `pi#`/`R#`/`g#` (every name [`crate::eval::lookup_constant`] knows) as
//! numeric literals carrying their raw SI unit string, so a constant never
//! reaches the solver as a variable and the unit checker can ground downstream
//! variables from it. [`builtin_constants`] survives as a knowns hook — it
//! collects nothing on documents from this parser (folding leaves no `#`
//! variables behind) but keeps hand-built ASTs and the component expander
//! honest.
//!
//! # Evaluation failures inside the Newton loop
//!
//! [`crate::eval`] turns domain errors (division by zero, `ln` of a
//! non-positive, `sqrt` of a negative) into hard errors where Java returns
//! `NaN`. That is the right call for a user-facing expression evaluation and
//! the wrong one inside a line search, where the solver *expects* to probe
//! invalid regions and back off. The engine bridges the two: the residuals are
//! evaluated once at the initial point and any failure there is reported
//! verbatim (that is where a genuinely broken document — unknown function,
//! wrong arity, a string used as a number — shows up); after that, an
//! `Evaluation`/`Property` failure is reported to Newton as a non-finite
//! residual, which is the signal its Jacobian probing and step halving are
//! already written to handle.

/// **Established by reading `EquationParser.parseResult`** (`../frEES/backend/
/// core/src/main/java/com/frees/backend/parser/EquationParser.java:265-345`),
/// which runs, in order:
///
/// ```text
///   AstBuilder.buildProgram(program)                       // parse
///   new ComponentExpander(ComponentLibrary.builtins(), …)  // <- HERE
///   componentEquations = components.expand()
///   statements         = components.rewriteStatements(statements)
///   …storage routing (steadyStorageEquations / routeStorageIntoDynamic)…
///   List<Equation> equations = new BoundedEquationList(componentEquations);
///   flatten(statements, …, equations, …)                   // CALL + matrix + FOR
///   equations = StringVariables.resolve(equations, displayNames)
/// ```
///
/// and only then does `EquationSystemSolver.solve` run `ComplexExpansion.expand`
/// and block. So expansion is **the first expansion pass**: before CALL
/// flattening, before matrix expansion, before complex, and well before
/// blocking. Two consequences are load-bearing rather than incidental:
///
/// * the component equations are the **seed** of the list (`new
///   BoundedEquationList(componentEquations)`), so they come *before* every
///   equation the document itself wrote — this port prepends for the same
///   reason, and the residual list, block ordering and `block_equations` all
///   inherit that order;
/// * `rewriteStatements` runs on the statements *before* they are flattened, so
///   a dotted `P1.out.h` inside a `FOR` body or a `CALL` argument is rewritten
///   once, at the AST level, and the later passes only ever see flat names.
///
/// # Storage
///
/// `hasStorage()` (any component body with `der(member) = …`) picks one of the
/// two branches `EquationParser.parseResult` spells, and Phase 7 makes both
/// reachable:
///
/// * **no `DYNAMIC` block** → the §8.2 steady/transient duality. Each
///   `der(X) = rhs` becomes the equilibrium constraint `rhs = 0` and the state
///   is an ordinary unknown. That is [`steady_storage_equations`].
/// * **exactly one `DYNAMIC` block** → `routeStorageIntoDynamic`. The component
///   equations *become* that block's body, the `init(member) = …` lines become
///   its initial conditions, and the steady equation list is emptied. The same
///   network then runs under the ODE engine, whose per-step algebraic solve
///   resolves it at each state.
///
/// Two or more blocks with storage is a hard parse error in the Java, because
/// nothing says which block supplies the time span.
///
/// Every `DYNAMIC` body is also put through `rewriteDynamicBodies` first: the
/// block's own equations live *inside* the block, so `rewrite_statements` never
/// saw them, and a scheduled input written as `RIN.out.mdot = f(time)` would
