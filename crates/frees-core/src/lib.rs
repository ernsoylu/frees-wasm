//! # frees-core
//!
//! The frees computational engine, ported from
//! `../frEES/backend/core` (Java, 134 files / 38,181 LOC).
//!
//! This crate is **target-agnostic on purpose**: it has no `wasm-bindgen`
//! dependency and compiles for `x86_64` and `wasm32-unknown-unknown` alike. The
//! native build is what runs the parity harness against the Java oracle at full
//! speed; the wasm build is what ships. A port that can only be tested in a
//! browser cannot be trusted (see `PLAN.md` §2).
//!
//! ## Engine invariants
//!
//! These come from the parent engine and must survive the port:
//!
//! * frees is an **equation solver**, not a sequential language — statements are
//!   order-independent.
//! * Variable names are **case-insensitive** (stored lowercase).
//! * **All calculation is in SI.** Unit-annotated literals convert at parse
//!   time; unit warnings never block a solve.
//! * Types follow naming convention: `$` → string, `#` → constant, `[]` →
//!   array, `_r`/`_i` → complex components.
//! * Solving is **Tarjan SCC blocking, then Newton with step-halving** per block.
