//! The ODE driver: the time loop, step guards, dense-output sampling and event
//! detection.
//!
//! Port of
//! `../frEES/backend/core/src/main/java/com/frees/backend/core/ode/OdeIntegrator.java`.
//!
//! It owns everything except the single-step advance, which it delegates to a
//! pluggable [`OdeMethod`] (explicit Runge–Kutta or stiff Rosenbrock/BDF).
//! Accepted steps are stored as `(t, y, f)` knots; output is sampled at evenly
//! spaced times via cubic Hermite interpolation, and event switching functions
//! are monitored for zero crossings between knots (bracket + bisection on the
//! same interpolant).
//!
//! # Dense output is Hermite, not the method's own interpolant
//!
//! Every method — including the FSAL Dormand–Prince pair, which *has* a
//! published 4th-order dense-output formula — is sampled through the same cubic
//! [`hermite`] built from the two bracketing knots and their derivatives. That
//! is what the Java does, so it is what the oracle's `ode_tables` rows contain,
//! and substituting a higher-order interpolant would change every sampled value.
//! The same interpolant is what event bisection refines on, which keeps a
//! crossing time consistent with the row the table reports around it.
//!
//! # No clock
//!
//! The Java `guard` checks both a step budget and a `System.nanoTime()`
//! deadline. `wasm32-unknown-unknown` has no clock (see [`crate::integral`],
//! which drops the same check for `IntegralSolver`), so [`MAX_STEPS`] is the
//! only bound here.

// The event/interpolation helpers thread the two bracketing knots plus the
// switching state through as separate parameters, exactly as the Java does.
// Bundling them into a struct to satisfy an argument count would obscure the
// line-for-line correspondence with `OdeIntegrator.java`.
#![allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]
// Numerical kernels index parallel arrays by the same loop variable, mirroring
// the Java being transcribed — the same call `crate::linalg` makes.
