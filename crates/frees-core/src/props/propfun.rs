//! Real-fluid property functions — the CoolProp-facing surface.
//!
//! Port of
//! `../frEES/backend/core/src/main/java/com/frees/backend/props/PropertyFunctions.java`
//! (537 LOC) together with the four-function façade it calls through,
//! `props/CoolProp.java`.
//!
//! # What is here, and what cannot be
//!
//! Everything in `PropertyFunctions.java` that is *dispatch* — the fluid alias
//! table, the glycol-mixture grammar, the output/indicator key maps, the branch
//! order of `evaluate`, the humid-air arity rules, the seeding helpers — is
//! ported line for line. It is what decides **which** CoolProp call a
//! document's `Enthalpy(R134a, T=…, x=…)` becomes, and it has to agree with the
//! Java exactly or a browser solve silently answers a different question.
//!
//! What cannot be ported is CoolProp itself. So the four calls the Java makes
//! into the native library become one trait, [`RealFluid`], and the engine
//! holds **at most one** installed implementation ([`install`], [`backend`]),
//! exactly as the Java holds at most one loaded `LIB`:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Java                                    Rust
//!   CoolProp.LIB != null                    propfun::is_available()
//!   CoolProp.propsSI(...)       throws      propfun::props_si        -> Result
//!   CoolProp.propsSIOrNaN(...)  NaN         propfun::props_si_or_nan -> f64
//!   CoolProp.props1SI(...)      throws      propfun::props1_si       -> Result
//!   CoolProp.haPropsSI(...)     throws      propfun::ha_props_si     -> Result
//! ```
//!
//! **With no backend installed, every real-fluid call fails with an error that
//! names the fluid, both indicators and their values.** That is the one
//! behaviour this module will not compromise on: a build that cannot reach a
//! property must say which property it could not reach — never extrapolate,
//! never quietly return a plausible number.
//!
//! # Backends
//!
//! * [`TableBackend`] — serves `(P, h)` flashes from a
//!   [`crate::props::satsplit::SaturationSplitTable`] per fluid, the browser's
//!   intended hot path (decision D1). Its accuracy is the table's
//!   (`~1e-5…1e-4` relative); it declines every state outside its box.
//! * Anything else a host installs — a `coolprop.wasm`, a JS bridge, a test
//!   double — by implementing [`RealFluid`].
//!
//! # Not ported, deliberately
//!
//! `LENIENT` / `enterLenient` / `exitLenient` / `guardedPropsSI` and the
//! `sanitize` clamps exist only for the SUNDIALS IDA transient residual path
//! (Phase 8). There is no transient solver in this build to enable them, and a
//! clamp that is on when nothing sets it would silently rescue a *steady* solve
//! from an out-of-range state — the precise failure mode this module exists to
//! prevent. They land with the DAE integrator, not before.
//!
//! `PhTableRegistry` (the per-fluid lazy cache and its 300-sample validation
//! gate) is likewise absent: its whole design is "intercept `(P,Hmass)`, else
//! fall through to the native call", and in the browser there is nothing to
//! fall through to. [`TableBackend`] is the browser's answer to the same
//! question and says so when it cannot serve a state.

// PARITY RULE. `nominalEnthalpy`'s guard is written `!(P > 0)` in the Java, and
// the negation is load-bearing: it is what makes a NaN pressure fail the test.
// Rewriting it as `P <= 0` (what `neg_cmp_op_on_partial_ord` asks for) would
// let NaN through and seed the solver with a garbage enthalpy. The negated form
// stays, and the lint is silenced here rather than at each site so the shape is
// obviously deliberate — same treatment as `eval.rs`, `linalg.rs`, `nasa.rs`.

/// `props/CoolProp.java` holds `PROPS_CACHE` and `HA_CACHE`: two
/// `LinkedHashMap(16, 0.75f, true)` — access-ordered, evicting the eldest past
/// 20 000 entries — keyed by the *whole* call, `(output, name1, prop1, name2,
/// prop2, fluid)` for `PropsSI` and `(output, name1, prop1, name2, prop2,
/// name3, prop3)` for `HAPropsSI`. Its own comment says why: "PropsSI is a pure
/// function of its arguments: repeated states — iterative solves circling a
/// fixed point … skip the global-lock native call entirely." This module was
/// ported without them, and CLAUDE.md's dependency table asked for them by name
/// ("keep the same four-call façade, **including the existing LRU caches**").
///
/// What that costs is measured rather than guessed. Replaying
/// `fixtures/corpus/ev-battery-cooling-pid.frees` — the document that is 61 %
/// of the parity gate's wall clock — makes **5 539 832** `props_si` calls for
/// **162 893** distinct argument tuples. 97.1 % of every property call in that
/// solve repeats a tuple already answered, and **84.1 % repeat the immediately
/// preceding call verbatim**. That shape is exactly the one the Java comment
/// describes: a finite-difference Jacobian re-evaluates a block's residuals once
/// per variable, and a property call whose two arguments do not involve the
/// perturbed variable is asked the identical question every time. Four of the
/// six call shapes that document uses have **one or two** distinct tuples across
/// the whole 4000-second transient — `Hmass(Water, P=200 kPa, T=305 K)` is asked
/// 54 757 times and has exactly one answer.
///
/// # Why the capacity is one, and not the Java's 20 000
///
/// Under the Java the cache was pure bookkeeping: CoolProp's `PropsSI` *is* a
/// pure function of its arguments, so a hit and a miss return the same double at
/// any capacity. Here it is not, quite. [`super::rustprop_warm`] seeds each
/// `(P,Hmass)`/`(P,Smass)` flash from the previous answer, so the answer to a
