//! [`RustpropBackend`] — the accuracy path of decision D8
//! (`docs/decisions/0008-coolprop-wasm.md`), served by **rustprop**, the
//! pure-Rust CoolProp 8 port, as a direct cargo dependency rather than an
//! emscripten `coolprop.wasm` blob.
//!
//! The four [`RealFluid`] calls forward 1:1 to `rustprop::props_si` /
//! `rustprop::ha_props_si`; every rustprop error becomes a
//! [`FreesError::Property`] carrying the rustprop message, which the engine
//! classifies exactly as it classifies the Java's
//! `PropertyEvaluationException`.
//!
//! Fluids go to rustprop **under their plain names, never an `IF97::`
//! prefix**: the frees parity oracle is the native CoolProp default backend,
//! i.e. IAPWS-95 HEOS for water, and IF97 diverges from it at ~1e-6 — two
//! orders looser than the tightest fixture tolerances.
