//! The property tables this build ships, and the backend they serve.
//!
//! Decision D1 (`docs/decisions/0001-property-backend.md`) chose precomputed
//! phase-split `(P,h)` tables, generated offline by native CoolProp
//! (`tools/table-gen`), as the browser build's real-fluid property source. This
//! module is where that decision becomes a running engine: it carries the
//! generated `FRPHTAB1` artifacts, decodes them once, and installs the resulting
//! [`TableBackend`](super::propfun::TableBackend) as the process's
//! [`RealFluid`](super::propfun::RealFluid).
//!
//! # Linked, not fetched — and why that diverges from D1
//!
//! D1 says the tables are "lazily fetched per fluid, not linked into the wasm,
//! so the wasm budget is untouched". They are linked here instead. The reason
//! is that a solve is **synchronous**: `PropsSI` is called from inside the
//! Newton residual, and there is no point in that call stack where a Rust
//! engine can await a `fetch`. Making it work the D1 way means either
//! pre-fetching every table at worker start-up — which pays the same bytes on
//! every page load, and pays them *before* the first solve rather than during
//! it — or restructuring the solver around an async property source. Linking
//! keeps the engine usable from `frees-cli`, the parity harness and the browser
//! through one code path.
//!
//! What linking costs is now ~678 KB rather than the 1014 KB the artifacts
//! occupy on disk: they are deflated by `build.rs` and inflated once here, at
//! install time. See [`mod@packed`] and `build.rs` for the container and for
//! why a byte-plane shuffle is what makes deflate bite on `f32` grids that
//! D7 measured as barely compressible.
//!
//! The seam D1 wanted is still here: [`install_from_bytes`] takes an arbitrary
//! `FRPHTAB1` slice, so a fetched table can be added at runtime without
//! recompiling. What is linked is a floor, not a ceiling.
//!
//! # …and in the browser build the floor is now zero (D9)
//!
//! Decision D9 (`docs/decisions/0009-rustprop-backend.md`) makes **rustprop**
//! the wasm build's property source, so the browser no longer consults these
//! tables at all — and the `linked-tables` Cargo feature takes the ~678 KiB of
//! packed artifacts out of that bundle. `linked-tables` is on by default, so a
//! native build, `frees-cli` and every `--no-default-features`-free test still
//! link them exactly as before; `frees-wasm` is the one crate that switches
//! them off. Only the *bytes* are conditional: [`unpack`], the two decoders and
//! [`install_from_bytes`] compile either way, because a fetched table is what
//! is left of D1 once the linked floor is gone.
//!
//! # What is here
//!
//! Two fluids, water and R134a, at the grid D1 measured (`n_sat = 512`,
//! `144 × 72` per phase piece, `f32`, normalized liquid coordinate). Their
//! measured error against CoolProp 8.0.0 is in
//! `fixtures/proptables/ERROR-REPORT.json`: worst case `2.1e-4` relative, and
//! that single number is entropy in subcooled liquid near the triple point
//! where water's entropy reference passes through zero — `0.05 J/kg·K` in
//! absolute terms. Everything the pending fluid fixtures actually touch is at or
//! below `6.6e-5`.
//!
//! Everything else — every other fluid, humid air, transport properties,
//! supercritical states, mixtures and incompressibles — is **declined by name**
//! by the backend rather than approximated. See
//! [`TableBackend`](super::propfun::TableBackend).
