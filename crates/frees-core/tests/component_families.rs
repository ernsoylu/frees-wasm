//! Coverage gate for the shipped component library.
//!
//! `tests/parity.rs` already proves that every `fixtures/corpus/components_*`
//! document reproduces the Java oracle. What it cannot say is **how much of the
//! 295-component library those documents touch**, and that number is the whole
//! point of Phase 6 — a library that parses but is never instantiated is not
//! evidence of anything.
//!
//! So this file measures two different things and pins both:
//!
//! 1. [`every_domain_family_has_a_solving_fixture`] — one document per domain
//!    family in `fixtures/corpus/components_family_*.frees`, each of which
//!    **solves** through [`frees_core::solve`] and (via `parity.rs`) matches the
//!    Java engine. That is the "representative document per family" gate.
//! 2. [`library_instantiation_coverage`] — every one of the 295 built-ins is
//!    instantiated on its own and pushed through the expander. This does *not*
//!    solve them: a physically well-posed boundary condition per component is a
//!    modelling problem, not a test. It proves the definition parses, its ports
//!    resolve, its parameters bind and its body rewrites onto flat scalar
//!    equations — which is exactly the part of the library the port owns.
//!
//! The counts are asserted as **floors that must be re-measured, not raised by
//! hand**: if the library grows, the floors do not silently pass a smaller
//! fraction, because the totals are read from
//! [`frees_core::components::library`].
