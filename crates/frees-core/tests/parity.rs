//! Golden-corpus parity replay — the Rust engine against the Java oracle.
//!
//! Every fixture in `fixtures/golden/` was produced by running the document in
//! `fixtures/corpus/` through the reference Java engine
//! (`tools/golden-dumper`). This test replays the same documents through the
//! Rust engine and compares.
//!
//! Comparison policy (`fixtures/README.md`):
//! * `variables` — relative tolerance `1e-9`, absolute `1e-12` near zero. A
//!   *named variable of a named fixture* may instead be graded by a declared
//!   **absolute** tolerance — see "The absolute channel" below.
//!   Golden keys carry the Java first-seen spelling (`T_out`); the Rust engine
//!   keys by lowercase canonical name, so keys are folded before matching.
//!
//!   The fold is the Java's own: `EquationSystemSolver.buildResult` keys
//!   `Result.variables()` with `displayNames.getOrDefault(name, name)`, so the
//!   golden's key is a *display* name, not a canonical one. For a scalar
//!   document the two coincide once lowercased (`T_out` → `t_out`), which is
//!   why folding the golden alone worked for the whole pre-component corpus.
//!   It stops coinciding the moment components expand: the canonical name is
//!   `s2$p` and its display name is `s2.P`. So this replay routes the **Rust**
//!   side through the same `display_names` map before lowercasing — identical
//!   to the previous behaviour on every non-component fixture, and the only
//!   thing that makes a component fixture comparable at all.
//! * `display_names` — **exact**: keys and values must match the Java
//!   `ParseResult.displayNames` map the dumper recorded, spelling included.
//! * `block_count` — exact. A different blocking is a real divergence.
//! * `error` — the *classification* must agree (both solve, or both fail with
//!   the equivalent error type). Messages are not compared verbatim.
//! * `ode_tables` — one entry per `DYNAMIC` block, compared in declaration
//!   order. `name`/`method`/`columns`/`stopped` and the event `name`s are
//!   **exact**; `end_time` and every event `time` go through the same numeric
//!   tolerance as `variables`. Row cells take the same tolerance **plus a
//!   scale anchor**: a cell also passes when `|a − e| ≤ rel_tol · scale`,
//!   where `scale` is the max `|expected|` over that signal's own trajectory
//!   (the `time` column is excluded — sample times are grid structure, not
//!   integrated state). See "The decayed-signal measure" below.
//!
//! # The decayed-signal measure (Wave G1)
//!
//! A pointwise relative measure has no denominator on a signal that decays
//! through zero: `pressure-cooker`'s `steel$port$qdot` falls from 1 497.86 W
//! to 2.27e-10 W, where a 4.4e-5 W absolute agreement — 2.9e-8 of the
//! signal — reads as rel 5.7e-3 purely by denominator collapse. The digits a
//! pointwise measure demands there were never controlled by either engine:
//! both integrators run error control of the `atol + rtol·|y|` shape (the
//! IDA path at rtol 1e-6 / atol 1e-8), so the trailing digits of a decayed
//! tail are integration noise on both sides. Anchoring the tolerance to the
//! signal's own dynamic range is the same measure the integrators
//! themselves use, and it changes nothing for a healthy signal (there
//! `|e| ≈ scale`). The anchor uses the *expected* side's range only, so a
//! wrongly-huge Rust value cannot widen its own gate; a column whose golden
//! is all zeros gets `scale = 0` and keeps the pointwise measure (which
//! `ABS_TOL` already handles).
//!
//! Validated the same way the row comparison itself was: perturbing a
//! decayed-tail cell of `pressure-cooker`'s golden (`steel$port$qdot`,
//! row 240, −2.2719987170207744e-10 → 0.02) produces
//!
//! ```text
//!   [pressure-cooker] ode_tables[0] `cooker` rows row 240 col `steel$port$qdot` =
//!   -0.00000000022851085812685354 but Java got 0.02 (rel 1.000000011425543e0,
//!   scaled 1.3e-5 of column max |e| 1.498e3, tolerance 1.1e-6)
//! ```
//!
//! and the classic `dyn_plain_ode` 47.59… → 47.6 perturbation still goes red
//! (rel 1.8995734320745376e-4, scaled 9.5e-5 of column max |e| 9.500e1 —
//! five decades over the default either way). Both were observed in the same
//! 2/775 run on 2026-08-23, then the goldens were restored.
//!
//! # Why the `ode_tables` comparison is not optional
//!
//! **A solved `DYNAMIC` block puts nothing in `variables`.** The trajectory is a
//! first-class ODE Table, so a transient document's `variables` map holds only
//! its analytic parameters — `dyn_plain_ode` has exactly `{k, Tinf}` in it. A
//! fixture that compared `variables` alone would therefore pass *vacuously* on
//! every transient document in the corpus: the whole integration could be wrong,
//! or absent, and the gate would stay green.
//!
//! The comparison was validated the way the harness itself was in Phase 1 — by
//! perturbing a golden and watching the gate go red. Perturbing
//! `dyn_plain_ode`'s row `[20, 47.59095803046333]` to `47.6` produces
//!
//! ```text
//!   [dyn_plain_ode] ode_tables[0] `cooling` row 1 col `temp` = 47.59095803046333
//!   but Java got 47.6 (rel 1.9e-4, tolerance 1e-9)
//! ```
//!
//! and dropping the table entirely produces "Java recorded 1 ODE table(s), Rust
//! produced 0". Both were observed, then the golden was restored.
//!
//! # Per-fixture tolerance
//!
//! `fixtures/tolerances.json` may relax the *numeric* tolerance for a named
//! fixture, and nothing else. It exists because this build resolves real-fluid
//! properties from precomputed tables whose measured error is `1e-7…1e-4`
//! (decision D1) while the goldens hold full-accuracy CoolProp values — a gap no
//! table-backed engine can close, and one that must not be hidden by loosening
//! the gate for everybody. Three guards keep it honest:
//!
//! * a fixture named there but **absent** from `fixtures/golden/` fails;
//! * a fixture named there that **passes at the default** fails, so a tolerance
//!   that is no longer needed cannot sit in the file pretending it is. "Passes
//!   at the default" is judged over *everything numeric the fixture grades* —
//!   variables, ODE row cells (under the decayed-signal measure above),
//!   `end_time` and event times — because a transient fixture's divergence
//!   usually lives in its table, not its variables, and a guard that only read
//!   `variables` would kill every transient entry as dead on arrival;
//! * if the file catalogues its `mechanisms`, every entry must name one that
//!   exists and every catalogued mechanism must be named by an entry — see
//!   [`declared_tolerances`].
//!
//! # The absolute channel (Wave P1)
//!
//! A relative measure has no denominator against an **exact zero**, and the
//! corpus contains quantities that are identically zero by physics: a condenser
//! outlet still inside the dome makes `SC = Tcond − Temperature(P,h)` exactly 0,
//! an evaporator outlet below `hg` makes `SH = Temperature(P,h) − Tsat` exactly
//! 0. The CoolProp 8.0.0 wheel confirms both — at all four states in
//! `fixtures/tolerances-rustprop.json`'s `absolute` section, `Temperature(P,h)`
//! equals `T_sat(P)` *to the last bit* — and this engine returns `0` or one ulp
//! of a ~300 K temperature (`±5.7e-14`). The Java oracle answers the same call
//! from its `(P,Hmass)` interpolation table and returns `2.8e-7 … 1.2e-6` K, so
//! the golden asserts the oracle's own table error and every such variable reads
//! `rel ≈ 1.0` by denominator collapse. Nothing is wrong with the engine; the
//! *channel* was missing.
//!
//! So the tolerance file may carry an `absolute` section, and it is deliberately
//! **narrower than a relative entry in two ways**:
//!
//! * it is **per variable**, not per fixture — an absolute entry names the
//!   variables it covers, so a second divergence anywhere else in the same
//!   document still fails at the ordinary relative tolerance;
//! * it grades `variables` only. ODE row cells, `end_time` and event times keep
//!   the relative measure plus the scale anchor above, which is the same idea
//!   applied to a trajectory.
//!
//! A covered variable passes when `|a − e| ≤ absolute`, and is left **out of the
//! `worst` accumulator** that feeds the dead-relative-tolerance guard — its
//! `rel ≈ 1.0` would otherwise keep a dead relative entry looking alive
//! forever.
//!
//! Five guards: four mirror the relative channel's, and the last is one the
//! relative channel cannot have. [`declared_absolutes`] owns the checks that
//! need only the file, [`replay`] the ones that need the golden value, and
//! [`golden_corpus_parity`] the two stale-entry sweeps:
//!
//! * an entry whose fixture is not in `fixtures/golden/` fails;
//! * an entry naming a variable the golden does not have fails, and so does one
//!   the replay never reaches — a typo must not silently grade nothing;
//! * a variable that passes at its fixture's relative tolerance fails, exactly
//!   as a dead relative entry does;
//! * `ABS_TOL < absolute < ABS_CEILING`. The floor is the harness's own
//!   near-zero acceptance, below which the entry could not change an outcome.
//!   `ABS_CEILING` is `1e-4`, and the number is argued in kelvin because that is
//!   the unit every instance is in: the smallest *legitimately non-zero*
//!   superheat this corpus grades is 0.2522 K
//!   (`chiller-higher-refrigerant-flow-delivers-more-cooling-2`, held open by a
//!   zone ramp and agreed to four figures by both engines), so `1e-4` K is
//!   2 500× below the smallest real signal of this kind, and it also sits under
//!   the worst `(P,Hmass)→T` table error the corpus has measured (1.53e-4 …
//!   1.56e-4 K, the three chiller entries) — an entry needing more than the
//!   ceiling is claiming a bigger oracle artifact than any yet measured and owes
//!   fresh evidence rather than a bigger number;
//! * `absolute ≤ 2 · |expected|`, checked per variable against the golden. This
//!   is the bound that makes the channel self-limiting: where the true value is
//!   exactly zero, `|expected|` *is* the oracle's error, so forgiving more than
//!   twice it stops hiding the oracle's artifact and starts hiding the port's
//!   own. It also means the channel can never be pointed at a healthy variable
//!   to widen it. The file's measured-×1.5 rule leaves ~33 % of slack under it,
//!   deliberately.
//!
//! One limit follows from that last bound and is accepted: a golden of exactly
//! `0.0` admits no absolute entry at all. If the *port* returns more than
//! `ABS_TOL` where the oracle returns a true zero, the artifact is on this side
//! and deserves an investigation, not a widening.
//!
//! Validated red the way the decayed-signal measure and the `ode_tables`
//! comparison were — by breaking it four ways in one run on 2026-08-24 and
//! watching each report land, then restoring. Observed, in a `4/1257` run:
//!
//! ```text
//!   [chgclosed-charge-chain-is-well-posed] `cnd.sc` = 0.00000000000005684341886080802
//!   but Java got 0.00000027976881256108754 (abs 2.797687557176687e-7, declared
//!   absolute tolerance 1e-7)
//!
//!   [tpcharge-charge-sets-condensing-pressure-and-subcooling] declares an absolute
//!   tolerance for `cond.sc` of 2e-6, which is more than 2x the 0.0000005685998871740594
//!   the golden itself asserts there. Where the true value is an exact zero the golden
//!   IS the oracle's error, so a tolerance above twice it stops forgiving the oracle's
//!   artifact and starts hiding this engine's
//!
//!   [chgclosed-condensing-pressure-floats-with-ambient-and-charge] declares an
//!   absolute tolerance for `cnd.rho_out`, which passes at the fixture's relative
//!   tolerance 1.4e-6 (rel 4.7017152870485336e-8). Delete the absolute entry rather
//!   than leaving a dead channel in the file.
//!
//!   [accomp-air-coil-cools-and-dehumidifies] declares an absolute tolerance for
//!   `coil.ev.superheat`, which is not a variable of the golden fixture
//!   [accomp-air-coil-cools-and-dehumidifies] declares an absolute tolerance for
//!   `coil.ev.superheat` in fixtures/tolerances-rustprop.json, which the replay
//!   never reached
//! ```
//!
//! The fourth breakage reports twice, by design: a misspelled variable both
//! grades nothing and leaves the entry unreached. It also produced the proof
//! that this channel is load-bearing rather than decorative — with the entry
//! pointed elsewhere, the variable it should have covered fell through to the
//! ordinary measure and failed there:
//!
//! ```text
//!   [accomp-air-coil-cools-and-dehumidifies] `coil.ev.sh` = 0 but Java got
//!   -0.0000012156851880718025 (rel 1e0, tolerance 2e-7)
//! ```
//!
//! # The solver request (Wave Q)
//!
//! A fixture may carry a top-level **`request`** object — the non-default
//! parts of what the Java test handed
//! `EquationSystemSolver.solve(source, settings, specs, extraDefs)`. It exists
//! because a document is only half of a solve: `x^2 = 4` from a guess of −1
//! and from a guess of +1 are two different roots, and grading either at the
//! engine defaults would assert an answer the Java test never made. Before it,
//! the harvester dropped every such site by tag (`SKIP_SITE_TAGS`) — 47 of
//! them, complex mode included.
//!
//! The chain is Wave I's, one channel over: the harvester evaluates the Java
//! arguments into a `<name>.request.json` sidecar, `tools/golden-dumper`
//! rebuilds the same `SolverSettings` and `Map<String, VariableSpec>` from it
//! and records the golden **under them**, then embeds the sidecar verbatim
//! here; [`request_settings_of`] and [`request_overrides_of`] turn it back
//! into the pair `solve_with_tables` takes. Two sidecars can coexist on one
//! document (`curvefn-solves-inverse-problem-through-newton` carries a
//! Function Table *and* a guess), and the shapes are the wasm boundary's own
//! `stopCriteria` / `variableInfo` DTOs rather than a format invented here.
//!
//! **An absent field is the engine default and the empty override slice** —
//! byte-for-byte the previous call — so the 1281 fixtures that predate the
//! channel replay unchanged.
//!
//! # This replay needs the `rustprop-backend` feature
//!
//! Since Wave-3 F6/F8 the corpus holds twelve documents the `(P,h)`
//! `TableBackend` cannot serve **at all**, so it is replayable by exactly one
//! backend. Rather than fail twelve times with an error that names nothing,
//! [`golden_corpus_parity`] refuses up front and prints the command that
//! works — see [`WRONG_BACKEND`].
//!
//! # Sharding — keeping a growing gate bounded (Wave Q2)
//!
//! This is the project's longest gate and it grows with every wave: 983
//! fixtures at ~145 s two waves ago, **1 281 at ~362 s** now (release, this
//! box; 317.4 s of it inside the replay loop), and ~15 min of CI wall clock.
//! The replay is embarrassingly parallel across fixtures — each one is an
//! independent `solve` against its own golden — so two environment variables
//! may split it across processes:
//!
//! * `PARITY_SHARD_COUNT` — how many processes are replaying the corpus;
//! * `PARITY_SHARD_INDEX` — which one this is, `0 <= index < count`.
//!
//! **With neither set the replay is exactly what it always was**: one process,
//! every fixture, every comparison unchanged. With both set this process
//! replays the fixtures whose position in the *sorted* golden listing satisfies
//! `i % count == index`.
//!
//! Sorted-then-strided is a **partition**: every fixture lands in exactly one
//! shard and the union over `index in 0..count` is the whole corpus, by
//! construction rather than by convention. Striding rather than slicing is
//! deliberate — the listing is sorted by name and adjacent names are usually
//! the same family (the two-phase-cycle `chgclosed-*` documents, the `dyn_*`
//! transients), so a contiguous slice would hand one shard every expensive
//! document while another finished in seconds.
//!
//! ## How many shards — and the ceiling one fixture puts on all of them
//!
//! Measured per fixture on 2026-08-25 (release, an instrumented run over the
//! 1 281 fixtures, 317.4 s inside the replay loop, mean 248 ms), the cost is not
//! merely skewed, it is **concentrated in one document**:
//!
//! ```text
//!   ev-battery-cooling-pid                193.0 s   60.8 % of the whole replay
//!   component-port-units-fan-duct          12.0 s
//!   component-networks-fan-duct-real       11.1 s
//!   docs_tutorials_05                       8.3 s
//!   odelib-p20-stiff-reaction-chain-ode15s  6.1 s
//!   … top 20 of 1 281 = 89.4 % of the total
//! ```
//!
//! Read the *shares* rather than the seconds: this box is shared with other
//! agents and whole-run wall clock was seen anywhere between 178 s and 406 s.
//! The shape is the stable part, and it was measured twice to establish that —
//! a second independent instrumented run put the same fixture at 191.3 s of
//! 316.8 s (60.4 %), the top 20 at 90.0 %, and every partition figure below
//! within 2 % of the numbers quoted.
//!
//! No partition can put that fixture in two places, so **193 s is the floor for
//! any shard count** and the useful range of `N` is small. Measured against
//! that distribution:
//!
//! | strategy | N=2 | N=4 | N=8 |
//! |---|---:|---:|---:|
//! | stride over the sorted names (what this does) | 273.8 s | **227.7 s** | 202.7 s |
//! | greedy bin-pack by golden file size | 269.5 s | 209.8 s | 213.6 s |
//! | greedy bin-pack by *measured* cost (the oracle) | 193.0 s | 193.0 s | 193.0 s |
//!
//! **N = 4**, and the plain stride. Four takes the longest shard from 317.4 s
//! to 227.7 s and leaves the other three at 33.0 / 10.6 / 46.1 s; eight buys a
//! further 25 s for four more runners, and the file-size bin-pack — the only
//! cost proxy available without committing a cost table that would go stale —
//! is worth 8 % at N=4 and *negative* at N=8 (Spearman 0.74 against true cost:
//! good enough to rank, not good enough to pack; `component-port-units-fan-duct`
//! is a 1 KiB golden and 12 s of solve).
//!
//! The point of four is not today's 1.39×, it is the mandate: **the gate stays
//! bounded while the corpus grows.** New fixtures spread across four bins while
//! the critical path stays where it is, so the largest non-critical shard
//! (46.1 s) has room for the corpus to grow ~4× — 1 281 → ~5 400 fixtures —
//! before it reaches 193 s and the wall clock starts moving again.
//!
//! The honest reading of that table is that the parity gate's real lever is not
//! sharding at all: **one fixture is 61 % of it.** `ev-battery-cooling-pid` is a
//! PID-controlled transient graded through `ode_tables`, and until it gets
//! cheaper no amount of parallelism takes this job below ~3 min of replay.
//!
//! ### That lever has been pulled once — 2026-08-25, Wave R2
//!
//! The paragraph above is kept as written, because its *reasoning* is what the
//! shard table was derived from. Its seconds are now history. R2 ported the LRU
//! the Java façade keeps in front of CoolProp — `props/propfun.rs`'s `cache`
//! module, and `props/CoolProp.java` for the original — which this engine had
//! been missing: `ev-battery-cooling-pid` makes **5 539 832** property calls for
//! 162 893 distinct argument tuples, and 84 % of them repeat the call
//! immediately before them. Re-measured on a quiet box, paired and alternated,
//! user CPU:
//!
//! ```text
//!                                        before      after
//!   ev-battery-cooling-pid alone         79.4 s     44.5 s    1.78x
//!     (PARITY_SHARD_COUNT=1308 PARITY_SHARD_INDEX=855)
//!   the whole 1 308-fixture replay      167.9 s    132.3 s    -21.2 %
//!   the document's share of the gate     47.3 %     33.6 %
//! ```
//!
//! Two things there are worth carrying forward. The **whole** saving is this one
//! document — the rest of the corpus measures the same before and after, which
//! is exactly the concentration the table above describes. And the document is
//! *still* the critical path at a third of the gate, so the floor argument
//! survives with a smaller floor: ~44 s rather than ~193 s. The shard table's
//! own seconds predate both this change and Q3's, and want re-measuring before
//! anyone re-derives `N` from them.
//!
//! ## Why the gate is not weaker across the union
//!
//! Three things could make a shard assert less than a whole run does, and each
//! is closed:
//!
//! * **A shard that silently replays nothing.** Half a configuration (one
//!   variable set, the other absent or empty), a non-numeric count, a zero
//!   count, an index outside `0..count`, or a stride that selects no fixture
//!   all **panic**. There is no input to [`declared_shard`] that yields a green
//!   run over an empty set — which is the whole reason the split is safe to
//!   make.
//! * **The "declared in the tolerance file but no such fixture" sweep.** That
//!   is a property of the *corpus*, not of a slice of it, so it keeps reading
//!   the corpus: `paths` stays the full sorted directory listing and only the
//!   replay loop is strided. Every shard runs the sweep over all 1 281 stems —
//!   it reads a directory listing and not one fixture, so repeating it costs
//!   nothing — which means a stale entry fails `count` times rather than
//!   escaping into the shard nobody looked at.
//! * **The dead-entry guards** — a `fixtures` tolerance whose fixture matches
//!   at the default, a `solver_floor` whose fixture converges at the default,
//!   an `absolute` entry that passes relatively or names a variable the golden
//!   lacks. Each needs the replayed *value*, so each can only run where its
//!   fixture runs. That is exactly right: a fixture is in exactly one shard, so
//!   across the union every such entry is graded **exactly once** — never zero
//!   times, and never (as a whole-file check would under sharding) declared
//!   dead merely because this process did not replay it. The one that needed
//!   changing is the "the replay never reached this absolute entry" sweep in
//!   [`golden_corpus_parity`], which now considers only entries whose fixture
//!   is in *this* shard; every other entry is another shard's business. An
//!   entry naming a fixture that does not exist at all is not lost by that
//!   scoping — it belongs to no shard, and the whole-corpus sweep above already
//!   fails it in every shard.
//!
//! The `mechanisms` catalogue check ([`declared_tolerances`]) is untouched and
//! stays whole-file: every entry must name a catalogued slug and every
//! catalogued slug must be named by an entry. It reads only the tolerance file,
//! so it is as true in a shard as in a whole run, and it runs in all of them.
//!
//! Every run — sharded or not — prints a machine-readable census line
//!
//! ```text
//!   parity-shard: index=0 count=4 replayed=321 corpus=1281
//! ```
//!
//! so the union can be *checked* rather than assumed: sum `replayed` across the
//! shards and it must equal `corpus`. Measured that way on 2026-08-25 at N=4:
//! 321 + 320 + 320 + 320 = 1 281, and the unsharded run replayed 1 281.

Twelve of the corpus documents ask for HAPropsSI (the seven humid-air ones), \

backend serves none of those at all, so they do not miss a tolerance — they \
