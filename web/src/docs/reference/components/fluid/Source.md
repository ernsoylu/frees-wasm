# Source

A fluid boundary that supplies a stream at set conditions.

## Domain

A reusable **acausal fluid-domain** component — its thermofluid ports carry pressure `P`, mass-flow `ṁ`, and specific enthalpy `h`; a node enforces equal `P` and `Σṁ = 0`. Instantiate it and connect its ports; the constitutive equations below expand into the global scalar system.

## Ports

`out`

## Usage

```
Source inst(fluid$, mdot, P, T)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fluid$` | String | Fluid name (e.g. Water, R134a, Air). |
| `mdot` | Number | Mass flow rate [kg/s]. |
| `P` | Number | Pressure [Pa]. |
| `T` | Number | Temperature [K]. |

## Constitutive Equations

Instantiating the component expands these acausal equations (over its port members and parameters) into scalar equations solved by the standard Newton/Tarjan pipeline:

```
out.mdot = mdot
out.P    = P
out.h    = Enthalpy(fluid$, P=P, T=T)
```
