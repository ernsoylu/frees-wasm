# LiquidPipe

A single-phase liquid pipe with frictional pressure drop.

## Domain

A reusable **acausal liquid-domain** component — its single-phase liquid-coolant ports carry pressure `P`, mass-flow `ṁ`, and specific enthalpy `h`. Instantiate it and connect its ports; the constitutive equations below expand into the global scalar system.

## Ports

`in`, `out`

## Usage

```
LiquidPipe inst(fluid$, L, D, rough, domain$)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fluid$` | String | Fluid name (e.g. Water, R134a, Air). |
| `L` | Number | Length [m]. |
| `D` | Number | Diameter [m]. |
| `rough` | Number | Relative wall roughness. |
| `domain$` | String | Connector fluid family — one of `fluid`, `gas`, `oil`, `moistair`, `liquid`, `twophase`. |

## Constitutive Equations

Instantiating the component expands these acausal equations (over its port members and parameters) into scalar equations solved by the standard Newton/Tarjan pipeline:

```
out.mdot = in.mdot
out.h    = in.h
rho      = Density(fluid$, P=in.P, h=in.h)
mu       = Viscosity(fluid$, P=in.P, h=in.h)
A        = pi# / 4 * D^2
V        = in.mdot / (rho * A)
Re_d     = reynolds(rho, V, D, mu)
f        = friction_factor(Re_d, rough / D)
out.P    = in.P - f * (L / D) * rho * V^2 / 2
```
